# My Handy Toolbox

Basically this contains all code snippets that i wrote or came across that made my life writing code easier, _not by much tho since it's never easy :D_,
It also contains various js and css libraries and frameworks that do cool stuff i guess.

do note however that this is intended to be used in a ***WordPress Development Environment*** since i mainly write plugins for wordpress.

This repo's primary purpose to keep this thing updated properly since i have multiple versions of it and each one has something extra so imma try to sync them here.

If you do happen to come across this by any chance then do feel free to check it out if you want!
